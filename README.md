The assignments were implemetned using the following techologies:
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* OpenCV
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* Pytorch

## Model Validation
In this lab, numpy and pandas were explored in details. Also, forward propagation and backward propagation were implemented from scratch and used on Iris dataset.
## TensorFlow
In this lab, tensorflow modules were used to train a shallow neural network on both Iris dataset, and Boston dataset for classification and regression. 
## Pytorch
In this lab, Pytorch was explored in details. Moreover, a 2-layer neural network was trained on Iris dataset using Pytorch modules.
## Keras Eager Execution
In this lab, Keras Eager Execution was used on Breast Cancer dataset by training a 3-layers neural networks.
## Keras Optimization Techniques
In this lab, Keras modules were used on MNIST dataset **withouth CNN** to train a shallow neural networks using different optimizers (RMSProp, Adam,SGD).
